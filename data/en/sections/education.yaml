      content: I was selected to join the Omicron Delta Epsilon (ODE) International Honor Society for Economics as a member in my senior year. This is a lifetime credential that showcases an individual's dedication to the field of economics. Additionally, in my senior year, I was selected to become an MIT IDDEAS Scholar. IDDEAS Scholars are individuals who are selected for their research interests and potential as doctoral students. These students participate in a two-day immersive summit where they learn about doctoral-level research, discuss careers in academia, and gain advice about graduate school opportunities.
